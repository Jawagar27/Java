Complexitiy refers to a medium used to measure the efficiency of a program.

There are 2 popular methods to measure the efficiency. 
      1. Time complexity - refers to the amount of time it takes for a program to run. 
      2.Space complexity - amount of space required for a program to run. 
However, time complexity and space complexity are affected by numerous external factors. 
      1. IDE used
      2.Language used
      3.The number of variable used
      4.The hardware specs of the computer etc. 

Therefore it is difficult to measure time complexity and space complexity accurately. 

Thereby we use simple methods to measure time complexity by the input/ type of program used.
